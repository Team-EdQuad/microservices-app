Reading books is good for people. It helps us learn new words and also makes our grammar better. Books also give us new knowledge like science or history. When I read a book about dinosaurs, I learned many things I didnâ€™t know. Also, reading can be fun and helps us relax when we are bored. Sometimes I read stories about magic and heroes, and they make me imagine new things. Reading is better than just using the phone because it makes our brain work. That is why reading is a good habit.
