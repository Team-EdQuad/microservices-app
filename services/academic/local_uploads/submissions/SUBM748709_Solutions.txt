A person who has had a big impact on my life is my grandfather. He lived with us when I was younger, and he always had time to talk to me and share stories about his life. He taught me the importance of honesty, hard work, and kindness. Every morning, he would wake up early to work in the garden, and he always invited me to help, even when I didnâ€™t feel like it. While we worked, he told me stories about his childhood, including how he had to walk miles to school and how he helped support his family. These stories made me realize how lucky I am and reminded me never to take things for granted. My grandfather also encouraged me to never give up, even when things get hard. When I struggled with math, he sat with me every day until I started to understand it. Because of him, I try to work hard and be a better person every day. He passed away two years ago, but his lessons continue to guide me.
